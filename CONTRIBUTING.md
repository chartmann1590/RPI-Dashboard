## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

If you encounter any issues or bugs, please follow these steps to report them effectively:

1.  **Search Existing Issues:** Before submitting a new issue, search the project's GitHub repository to see if the issue has already been reported.
2.  **Create a New Issue:** If you couldn’t find an existing issue, create a new issue on the GitHub repository.
3.  **Provide Detailed Information:**  When creating the issue, please include the following:
    *   **A Clear and Concise Title:** Summarize the issue in a single, descriptive sentence.
    *   **Detailed Description:** Explain the issue thoroughly, including:
        *   Steps to reproduce the issue.
        *   Expected behavior.
        *   Actual behavior.
        *   Environment details (e.g., browser, operating system).
        *   Any relevant screenshots or error messages.
4. **Use specific language:**  Clear and descriptive language will greatly assist the team in understanding and resolving the issue.

### Suggesting Features

If you have ideas for new features or enhancements, we welcome your suggestions!  Here's how you can submit them:

1.  **Open Discussion:**  Start a discussion in the project's GitHub repository, preferably in the "Issues" section.
2.  **Describe Your Idea:** Clearly explain your proposed feature, including its purpose, functionality, and potential benefits.
3.  **Provide Context:**  Explain why you think this feature would be valuable to the project.
4.  **Be Open to Feedback:**  Be prepared to discuss your idea and incorporate feedback from the project maintainers.

### Pull Requests

Pull requests are the primary mechanism for submitting code changes.  Here’s how to submit a pull request:

1.  **Fork the Repository:**  Create your own copy of the repository on GitHub.
2.  **Create a Branch:**  Create a new branch in your forked repository for your changes.  Name the branch descriptively (e.g., `fix-battery-display`, `add-traffic-alerts`).
3.  **Make Changes:**  Make your code changes within the branch.
4.  **Test Your Changes:**  Thoroughly test your changes to ensure they work as expected and don’t introduce any new issues.
5.  **Commit Your Changes:**  Commit your changes with clear and descriptive commit messages.
6.  **Push Your Branch:**  Push your branch to your forked repository.
7.  **Create a Pull Request:**  Create a pull request from your forked repository to the main repository.  Provide a clear description of your changes and why they are beneficial.

## Development Setup

Based on the project files, here’s how to set up a development environment:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**  Clone the main project repository from GitHub using `git clone [repository URL]`.  (Replace `[repository URL]` with the actual URL of the repository.)
2.  **Install Dependencies:**  Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3.  **Set up the Environment:** You'll need to configure environment variables. You will need to set up a `.env` file to store sensitive configuration values.
4.  **Run the Application:**  To run the application, execute the main script: `python app.py`.
5. **Use the .env File**: You'll need to set the necessary environment variables in your .env file.

## Code Style

The project follows the following coding conventions:

*   **Docstrings:** Use docstrings to document all functions and classes, clearly outlining their purpose, arguments, and return values.
*   **Variable Naming:**  Use descriptive and meaningful variable names.
*   **Comments:** Add comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious code.
*   **Indentation:** Use consistent indentation (typically 4 spaces) for readability.

## Testing

(Due to the lack of explicit testing information in the original project, testing information is not available.  Add testing details if available)

## Questions

For any questions or assistance, please open an issue in the project's GitHub repository.  We'll do our best to respond promptly and help you contribute effectively.
